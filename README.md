### About this project

This project was taken out of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)'s second chapter, [Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html). I began reading through this publication in 2024 as a springboard into learning the Rust language, which I had wanted to learn both in preparation for some potential contract work and as a springboard into system-level languages and thier nuances. 

I didn't originally have any plans to push this work to github, and indeed regret not practicing any good commit practices, but eventually came to regret the decision. I'm going through the trouble of learning a language, and even if these are small, learning-oriented projects, they're still important.
